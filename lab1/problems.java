driving cost

distance/mpg of the car will give you gallons of gas used 

now that you have the gallons used, multiply by 4 to get gas 
expenditure.

then, calculuate the maintanance cost by multiplying the distance by .05

add the maintanence cost to the gas price to get total driving price

subtract the driving cost from the train ticket cost. 

if the number is negative, return that it is cheaper to drive

if the number is positive, return that it is more expensive to driv

if the number is zero, return there is no difference in price
